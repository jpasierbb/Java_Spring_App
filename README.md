Simple web app with validation and ORACLE Database CRUD operations made with Spring Boot and Bootstrap.
To run the app you need to have an ORACLE Database on your computer and modify application.proporties file.
To avoid any troubles with starting I recommend adding at least one record in every single table.

Made it with my great friend @atlomak
